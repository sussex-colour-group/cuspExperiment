# ok this works - now how should i format this massive struct?

# How does the psignifit PAS fit into this?

# then do analysis as planned using psignifit
# Hypothesis: Awareness is more important for detecting the hue correctly than for detecting the position of a stimulus.
# - The PAS psychometric function will be better correlated with the psychometric functions tracking hue than tracking location - plot psychometric functions on same axes. Predict that PAS psychometric function correlates better with hue than location.
# - Awareness will be better predictive of correct detection for the hue trials than for the location trials - logistic regression?
# - Reporting colour awareness will be more predictive of hue detection than location detection - logistic regression?

# Implementation: do this with one file at first, especially logistic regressions, then do the whole set when that works
